# 📊 Blockchain-based Research Citation Tracking

Welcome to a decentralized solution for tracking research citations and incentivizing researchers! This Web3 project, built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity, addresses the real-world problem of opaque and centralized citation tracking in academia. It ensures transparent, immutable, and verifiable citation records while rewarding researchers for their impact.

## ✨ Features

🔗 Track citations of research papers immutably on-chain  
🏆 Reward researchers with tokens based on citation impact  
📚 Register research papers with unique identifiers  
🔍 Verify citation authenticity and ownership  
📈 Calculate and distribute citation-based incentives  
🚫 Prevent fraudulent or duplicate citations  
👥 Enable collaboration tracking for co-authored papers  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Researchers**  
- Register your research paper with a unique hash (e.g., SHA-256 of the paper content).  
- Submit metadata (title, abstract, author list, DOI).  
- Cite other registered papers by referencing their on-chain IDs.  
- Earn tokens based on the number and quality of citations your paper receives.  

**For Institutions/Verifiers**  
- Query citation details to verify authenticity and impact.  
- Use on-chain data to evaluate researcher contributions transparently.  

**Token Incentives**  
- Citation tokens are minted and distributed to researchers based on citation weight (e.g., citing paper’s impact).  
- Tokens can be used for governance, funding access, or redeemed in partner ecosystems.
